    "text": "This exercise encourages students to discuss academic integrity, and in particular the grey areas often present. Your demonstrator will provide you with a number of scenarios to discuss with each other in smaller groups, and then with the class.\nIf you are interested in more information on Academic Integrity at the University of Sydney, see the following link: Academic Integrity. Also ensure you have completed the Academic Honesty Education Module (AHEM). This must be complete before your first assessment is due (next week for ENVX1002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nAt the end of this practical students should be able to:\n\nUse R to calculate simple summary statistics\nCreate basic plots using default R and ggplot\nDevelop your coding and Quarto skills\nDo basic data wrangling using dplyr\nProduce your own knitted Markdown document"

The skewness (g_1) of a data set gives an indication of its symmetry. The sign of the skewness tells us whether the data is positively or negatively skewed. It is useful as one source of evidence for determining whether the data has a symmetrical distribution, particularly when having to assess this for many variables at once. First we must install the package using the install.packages function and the load it using the library function. Note that I have put a comment # in front as I have already installed the package and you only need to install a package once!\n\n#install.packages(\"moments\")\nlibrary(moments)\n\nNow we can calculate the skewness of sulphate.\n\nskewness(water$SO4)\n\n[1] 0.1571807"
